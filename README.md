# compelling-python-profile-app
This repo contains a fully functional example AWS Lambda-based Python web app using Flask/Zappa/Bulma/DynamoDB. Serverless Flask is a great, inexpensive option for applications that need to auto-scale quickly and/or have extremely bursty usage (for instance, a reporting tool that is only used on the first of every month, or an application that only accepts submissions for small windows of time throughout the year). It's also a wonderful option for people who want to deploy quick one-off web apps that can stay up indefinitely with no monthly cost if people aren't using them. I use this particular example application to obtain author biographies for [compellingsciencefiction.com](http://compellingsciencefiction.com/).

This repo is used as an example in my Serverless Flask guide that can be found at [compellingpython.com](http://compellingpython.com).
